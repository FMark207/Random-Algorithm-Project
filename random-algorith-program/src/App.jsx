      desc="Quick integer sorting, or QuickSort, is a fast, efficient sorting algorithm used to sort a list of integers. It is based on the divide-and-conquer principle, where the list is divided into smaller sublists around a 'pivot' element."
      eff="QuickSort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), but in the worst case (when the pivot is poorly chosen), it can degrade to O(nÂ²). It is often preferred due to its efficient use of memory (in-place sorting) and generally fast performance for most datasets."
